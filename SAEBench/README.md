- **Sparse Probing**
- **[Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19278)**

For more information, refer to our [blog post](https://www.neuronpedia.org/sae-bench/info).

### Supported Models and SAEs

- **SAE Lens Pretrained SAEs**: Supports evaluations on any [SAE Lens](https://github.com/jbloomAus/SAELens) SAE.
- **dictionary_learning SAES**: We support evaluations on any SAE trained with the [dictionary_learning repo](https://github.com/saprmarks/dictionary_learning) (see [Custom SAE Usage](#custom-sae-usage)).
- **Custom SAEs**: Supports any general SAE object with `encode()` and `decode()` methods (see [Custom SAE Usage](#custom-sae-usage)).

### Installation

Set up a virtual environment with python >= 3.10.

```
git clone https://github.com/adamkarvonen/SAEBench.git
cd SAEBench
pip install -e .
```

Alternative, you can install from pypi:

```
pip install sae-bench
```

If you encounter dependency issues, you can use our tested working versions by uncommenting the fixed versions in pyproject.toml. All evals can be ran with current batch sizes on Gemma-2-2B on a 24GB VRAM GPU (e.g. a RTX 3090). By default, some evals cache LLM activations, which can require up to 100 GB of disk space. However, this can be disabled.

Autointerp requires the creation of `openai_api_key.txt`. Unlearning requires requesting access to the WMDP bio dataset (refer to `unlearning/README.md`).

## Getting Started

We recommend to get starting by going through the `sae_bench_demo.ipynb` notebook. In this notebook, we load both a custom SAE and an SAE Lens SAE, run both of them on multiple evaluations, and plot graphs of the results.

## Running Evaluations with SAE Lens

Each evaluation has an example command located in its respective `main.py` file. To run all evaluations on a selection of SAE Lens SAEs, refer to `shell_scripts/README.md`. Here's an example of how to run a sparse probing evaluation on a single SAE Bench Pythia-70M SAE:

```
python -m sae_bench.evals.sparse_probing.main \
    --sae_regex_pattern "sae_bench_pythia70m_sweep_standard_ctx128_0712" \
    --sae_block_pattern "blocks.4.hook_resid_post__trainer_10" \
    --model_name pythia-70m-deduped
```

The results will be saved to the `eval_results/sparse_probing` directory.

We use regex patterns to select SAE Lens SAEs. For more examples of regex patterns, refer to `sae_regex_selection.ipynb`.

Every eval folder contains an `eval_config.py`, which contains all relevant hyperparamters for that evaluation. The values are currently set to the default recommended values.

## Custom SAE Usage

Our goal is to have first class support for custom SAEs as the field is rapidly evolving. Our evaluations can run on any SAE object with `encode()`, `decode()`, and a few config values. We recommend referring to `sae_bench_demo.ipynb`. In this notebook, we load a custom SAE and an SAE Bench baseline SAE, run them on two evals, and graph the results. There is additional information about custom SAE usage in `sae_bench/custom_saes/README.md`.

If your SAEs are trained with the [dictionary_learning repo](https://github.com/saprmarks/dictionary_learning), you can evaluate your SAEs by passing in the name of the HuggingFace repo containing your SAEs. Refer to `sae_bench/custom_saes/run_all_evals_dictionary_learning_saes.py`.

For other SAE types, refer to `sae_bench/custom_saes/run_all_evals_custom_saes.py`.

We currently have a suite of SAE Bench SAEs on layer 8 of Pythia-160M and layer 12 of Gemma-2-2B, each trained on 500M tokens with some having checkpoints at various points. These SAEs can serve as baselines for any new custom SAEs. We also have baseline eval results, saved [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/adamkarvonen/sae_bench_results_0125). For more information, refer to `sae_bench/custom_saes/README.md`.

## Training Your Own SAEs

You can deterministically replicate the training of our SAEs using scripts provided [here](https://github.com/adamkarvonen/dictionary_learning_demo), or implement your own SAE, or make a change to one of our SAE implementations. Once you train your new version, you can benchmark against our existing SAEs for a true apples to apples comparison.

## Graphing Results

If evaluating your own SAEs, we recommend using the graphing cells in `sae_bench_demo.ipynb`. To replicate all SAE Bench plots, refer to `graphing.ipynb`. In this notebook, we download all SAE Bench data and create a variety of plots.

## Computational Requirements

The computational requirements for running SAEBench evaluations were measured on an NVIDIA RTX 3090 GPU using 16K width SAEs trained on the Gemma-2-2B model. The table below breaks down the timing for each evaluation type into two components: an initial setup phase and the per-SAE evaluation time.

- **Setup Phase**: Includes operations like precomputing model activations, training probes, or other one-time preprocessing steps which can be reused across multiple SAE evaluations.
- **Per-SAE Evaluation Time**: The time required to evaluate a single SAE once the setup is complete.

The total evaluation time for a single SAE across all benchmarks is approximately **65 minutes**, with an additional **107 minutes** of setup time. Note that actual runtimes may vary significantly based on factors such as SAE dictionary size, base model, and GPU selection.

| Evaluation Type | Avg Time per SAE (min) | Setup Time (min) |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Absorption      | 26                     | 33               |
| Core            | 9                      | 0                |
| SCR             | 6                      | 22               |
| TPP             | 2                      | 5                |
| Sparse Probing  | 3                      | 15               |

# SAE Bench Baseline Suite

We provide a suite of baseline SAEs. We have the following 7 SAE varieties:

- ReLU (Anthropic April Update)
- TopK
- BatchTopK
- JumpReLU
- Gated
- P-anneal
- Matryoshka BatchTopK

Trained across 3 widths (4k, 16k, and 65k), 6 sparsities (~20 to ~640), on layer 8 of Pythia-160M and layer 12 of Gemma-2-2B. Additionally, we have checkpoints throughout training for TopK and RelU variants for Gemma-2-2B 16k and 65k widths. The SAEs are located in the following HuggingFace repos:

- [Pythia-160M 4k width](https://huggingface.co/adamkarvonen/saebench_pythia-160m-deduped_width-2pow12_date-0108)
- [Pythia-160M 16k width](https://huggingface.co/adamkarvonen/saebench_pythia-160m-deduped_width-2pow14_date-0108)
- [Pythia-160M 65k width](https://huggingface.co/adamkarvonen/saebench_pythia-160m-deduped_width-2pow16_date-0108)
- [Gemma-2-2B 4k width](https://huggingface.co/adamkarvonen/saebench_gemma-2-2b_width-2pow12_date-0108)
- [Gemma-2-2B 16k width](https://huggingface.co/canrager/saebench_gemma-2-2b_width-2pow14_date-0107)
- [Gemma-2-2B 65k width](https://huggingface.co/canrager/saebench_gemma-2-2b_width-2pow16_date-0107)

All results from these SAEs, plus PCA / residual stream baselines, are contained [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/adamkarvonen/sae_bench_results_0125).

To evaluate these SAEs, refer to `custom_saes/run_all_evals_dictionary_learning.py`.

## Development

This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management and packaging.

To install the development dependencies, run:

```
poetry install
```

### Linting and Formatting

This project uses [Ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) for linting and formatting. To run linting, run:

```
make lint
```

To run formatting, run:

```
make format
```

To run type checking, run:

```
make check-type
```

### Testing

Unit tests can be run with:

```
poetry run pytest tests/unit
```

These test will be run automatically on every PR in CI.

There are also acceptance tests than can be run with:

```
poetry run pytest tests/acceptance
```

These tests are expensive and will not be run automatically in CI, but are worth running manually before large changes.

### Running all CI checks locally

Before submitting a PR, run:

```
make check-ci
```

This will run linting, formatting, type checking, and unit tests. If these all pass, your PR should be good to go!

### Configuring VSCode for auto-formatting

If you use VSCode, install the Ruff plugin, and add the following to your `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
  "[python]": {
    "editor.formatOnSave": true,
    "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {
      "source.fixAll": "explicit",
      "source.organizeImports": "explicit"
    },
    "editor.defaultFormatter": "charliermarsh.ruff"
  }
}
```

### Pre-commit hook

There's a pre-commit hook that will run ruff and pyright on each commit. To install it, run:

```bash
poetry run pre-commit install
```

### Updating Eval Output Schemas

Eval output structures / data types are under the `eval_output.py` file in each eval directory. If any of the `eval_output.py` files are updated, it's a good idea to run `python sae_bench/evals/generate_json_schemas.py` to make the json schemas match them as well.
